# Golem Beer Pseudo-AI
 A program that is dedicated to determine the type of beer based on varied inputs.

Note: This progam uses very simple nodes alongside purely random weight generator to generate robots which attemt to solve the task. Each robot is then graded, best of the generaion remian to multiply, as long as needed to obtain the best results.
This project uses little to none libraries, and can be used as a simple way to visualize the most basic AI.
